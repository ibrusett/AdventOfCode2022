# AdventOfCode2022
My bad Pyhton attempts for Advent of Code 2022

* [Day 1](AoC_01.py). File reading, list manipulation, sum and pop()

* [Day 2](AoC_02.py). Dictionaries, more dictionaries and sum

* [Day 3](AoC_03.py). More string manipulation, find common element in string(s)

* [Day 4](AoC_04.py). Area, overlapping, if and lambda
